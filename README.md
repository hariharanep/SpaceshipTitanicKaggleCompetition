# SpaceshipTitanicKaggleCompetition

In this classification Kaggle Competition, I explored some of the most popular machine learning algorithms to improve upon my knowledge of machine learning and to gain more experience working with different types of machine learning algorithms. For each algorithm, I preprocessed the training data provided by the Kaggle Competition differently depending on the assumptions that each algorithm made about the data, tuned the most influential hyperparameters for each algorithm with Bayesian Optimization, and compared the accuracies that each algorithm produced on the test dataset provided by the Kaggle Competition. In the end, the algorithm that produced the highest accuracy on the test dataset was the SVM algorithm.
